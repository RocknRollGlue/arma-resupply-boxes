# Rocks Supply Boxes

A quick attempt to bring some resupply boxes to mission makers and others enjoying an Arma 3 zeus experience.

I try to keep it simple and readable, if someone is interested in learning about modding in Arma 3.

The ``TextureHelper.xcf`` is a GIMP project file, for sign reference.

Make sure to either remove before build, or add ``*.xcf`` to the ``exclude.lst``
